#Reflection
1. Describe the path an HTTP Request takes from a browser to your GitHub Pages site.
First the browser will build an HTTP GET request for my page, then will do a DNS lookup, to which then DNS will return an IP address for the GitHub Pages server network. Then it will make a secure HTTPS connection and have the request sent to GitHub Pages and then GitHub Pages will then send back my files for the browser to render the page.
2. Docker Containers differ from GitHub Pages where a Docker Container is a packaged environment that lets you control your app and everything it needs to run. It runs the same way on any machine. GitHub Pages is a fixed hosting environment that only host static files, such as HTML, CSS and JS, and cannot run any backend. 
3. I asked ChatGPT "Please provide a checklist and some tips to start a CSS file from scratch (like where to start, etc)." and it did not give me any logical errors.
